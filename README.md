# About The Project
The Weather Forecast Front-End Application utilizes a real-time weather API 
to deliver detailed weather information in three-hour increments. Integrated 
with the [MatchCityNameApi](https://github.com/KrzysztofTybinka/MatchCityNameApi) it features a responsive auto-complete city search bar. 
The application dynamically showcases distinct weather images based on the current 
search, providing users with a visually intuitive representation of weather conditions.
